                            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                            <p class="right-indent">Altana started off as a few craft tweaker changes to <a href="https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-presents-direwolf20-1-12">FTB's
                            Direwolf20 mod pack</a>. It has since diverged into its own pack with a number of mods added, a few mods removed, a fair number of config file changes, and a
                            large number of craft tweaker changes to facilitate mod interaction. The world of Altana is intended to feel like a fantastical place of potent magic, advanced
                            technology, and wonderous creatures.</p>
                            
                            <p class="right-indent">Don't worry, its not <strong>that</strong> different from the Direwolf20 pack, if you are used to the Official mainline FTB packs you will
                            feel right at home with the Thermal Series, EnderIO, Immersive Engineering, Astral Sorcery, Botania, Thaumcraft, and the like. As a general rule things that have
                            been changed are now easier and/or cheaper, not harder or more expensive.</p>
                            
                            <p class="right-indent">Altana is a kitchen sink pack that focuses on modern modded Minecraft. There are more mods than most individual players will ever need
                            and there is a lot of functionality overlap between various mods. But while Altana does reward mixing different mods in a number of places it does not require
                            you to do so like an expert mode pack would. </p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Resource Packs and Optifine</strong></p>
                            <p class="right-indent">Altana includes the Persistance resource pack by default because I feel it does a good of making minecraft look better without
                            deviating too much from the vanilla asthetic. At the moment Altana includes Optifine becase it is more or less a private mod pack. If I ever decide to publish
                            Altana on Curseforge Optifine will have to be removed.</p>
                            
                        </div>
                        <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade scrolling_div">
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>Overall Goals</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>I once heard Direwolf20 say that the goal of his pack was to let people play the way they wanted by giving them multiple ways to do everything. I think that
                                this is an excelent design goal but meeting it requires defining just what "everything" means. Minecraft is a game where the player sets their own goals. What
                                one person enjoys doing may be totally different from another person. However I feel that all player defined goals fit into one of several broad catagories:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Architecture</strong><br>
                                        <div class="right-indent">Constructing and/or decorating buildings or other constructions.</div></li>
                                    <li><strong>Engineering</strong><br>
                                        <div class="right-indent">Designing and building automation systems.</div></li>
                                    <li><strong>Exploration</strong><br>
                                        <div class="right-indent">Exploring and becoming immersed the world.</div></li>
                                    <li><strong>Roleplay</strong><br>
                                        <div class="right-indent">Taking on the role of a character in the world.</div></li>
                                    <li><strong>Combat</strong><br>
                                        <div class="right-indent">Defeating challenging monsters or taking part in boss fights.</div></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>You can also think of these as the different aspects of Minecraft gameplay, with different people focusing more on different aspects. So to me, giving
                                players multiple ways to do everything means having lots of content avilable in each area as well as more than one way to solve most challenges.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p><strong>Mods and Content</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>Throwing a bunch of mods into a pack because you think they are cool is a good place to start. But aligning your mod choices with the gameplay catagories
                                outlined above results in a more cohesive gameplay experence. Here is a basic outline of how Altana tries to give players plenty to do in each catagory:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Architecture</strong><br>
                                        <div class="right-indent">Altana adds tons of new blocks that can be used for decoration but some of the highlights are:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Block Craftery - Ever wanted angles and smooth slopes? Now you can have them!</li>
                                                <li>Decocraft2 - So many decorative things it boggles the mind.</li>
                                                <li>Rustic - Chairs you can sit in! Pretty medieval looking things!</li>
                                                <li>Biomes O'Plenty - More wood types than you can shake a stick at.</li>
                                                <li>Quark - Blocks, flowerpots, and banners (and more) oh my!</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </div>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Engineering</strong><br>
                                        <div class="right-indent">The tech mods fill this very well. Some of the main ones are:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Thermal Expansion/Dynamics - The standard for tech mods.</li>

                                                <li>EnderIO - A classic.</li>
                                                <li>RFTools - Lots of fiddley bits with a million uses.</li>

                                        <div class="right-indent">There is a lot to see and discover. Some highlights are:

                            <p><strong>Early Game Power Systems</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>Early game power systems were a bit out of whack. The solar panel couldn't even be built early game and the windmill and water wheel just didn't
                                make enough power to be worth the effort required to build them. The coal generator from Actually Additions was far and away the best option early on.
                                Now all three are competitive early game power options with different pros and cons.</p>
                                
                                <p>The solar panel is super cheap and does not need fuel but is low output due to only working during the day. This prevents it from providing constant
                                power without some sort of battery system. Solar panels also create a very large number of grid connection points. The connection point requirments and
                                low output prevent solar panels from scaling into mid game very well.</p>
                                
                                <p>The windmill and water wheel make the most power and do not need any fuel but require the most effort and space to setup. They force you to spend a
                                lot of time and resources to get the most out of them and they force your power grid to cover more distance than the other early game generation options
                                do. The large space requirments of these systems make it hard to scale windmills and water wheels into mid game.</p>
                                
                                <p>The coal generator needs fuel but makes a reasonable amount of power. It is compact, easy to build, and does not force you to make your power grid
                                larger than it needs to be. Although it does not waste fuel it is not very fuel efficient and the constant need for low energy density fuel keeps it from
                                scaling into mid game.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Mid Game Power Systems</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>Mid game power systems were rather lacking. In older Direwolf20 packs the only reasonable options were spruce trees with Thermal Expansion machines or
                                canola oil from Actually Additions. Everything else just wasn't up to par. We now have more options. The main mid game power systems are listed in order
                                of roughly how hard/expensive they are to set up starting with the easiest/cheapest. The harder and/or more expensive an option is, the better it scales to
                                larger amounts of power production. There is a lot of overlap in the overall capibilites of these systems. This is intentional as it makes them all
                                potentially viable choices depending on your mid game power needs and what resources you have avilable. Note that all of these are technically renewable
                                power sources, even Oil.</p>
                                
                                <p>Thermoelectric Generators have been buffed into a mid game power option. They are easy to setup but they do require some planning to avoid setting your
                                base on fire. Although their output is much better than before it still isn't amazing and they don't have any upgrade options like the other systems do. Also
                                making a lot of them starts to need more lava than you may want to bother with. This makes scaling them somewhat hard.</p>
                                
                                <p>Canola Oil is unchanged. It is easy to setup and can make a reasonable amount of power in a renewable fashon. However it does not scale very well due
                                to the manual nature of higher tier canola refining and the generation limits of each oil generator.</p>
                                
                                <p>Tree Oil, aka Spruce Power, was a bit overpowered in earlier versions of Thermal Expansion and has been severely nerfed by the TE devs. They overdid the
                                nerf a bit and so it has been partially walked back. However the lower energy density of the fuel, the new requirment to spread extractors out across many
                                trees, and its reliance on the boiler/turbine conversion mechanic for high output keeps tree oil from scaling as well as the remaining two options.</p>
                                
                                <p>Grassoline is a new renewable power option in Thermal Expansion. The idea is that you process crops such as wheat into a liquid fuel that is then burned
                                for power. It takes more work to setup than tree power but scales better and eventually gets the option to move away from the boiler/turbine conversion
                                mechanic to a more efficient, and eventually more powerful, design based on the agitative manafold. If you dabble in Immersive Engineering enough to get the
                                garden cloche this becomes a very powerful generation system.</p>
                                
                                <p>Oil Power uses a mix of things from Thermal Expansion and Immersive Petroleum. First you have to use a core sample drill to locate a chuck with an oil
                                deposit. Then you have to build a pumpjack multiblock structure to extract the oil. The oil can then be processed into refined fuel and burned for energy.
                                This is a lot of effort and requires that you go down the Immersive Engineering tech tree to some extent. However it scales the best and has the easiest
                                time moving away from the boiler/turbine conversion mechanic to a far more efficient and powerful ignition plugs based design. It is also able to produce
                                sulfur and even cerosote oil as a byproduct of energy production.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Power Transmission Systems</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>Immersive Engineering wires are a low cost low capacity system overall. The cost of a powergrid based on IE wires scales up more so with the number of
                                connection points on the grid and less so with the distance the grid covers. Upgrading the grid to a higher capacity tier is more involved than with other
                                systems and connecting lower and higher tier wires requires extra transformer equipment.</p>
                                
                                <p>Thermal Dynamics fluxducts are unchanged and provide an expensive but high capacity system that offers some residual energy storage. The cost of a fluxduct
                                based grid scales more with the distance the grid covers and less from the number of connection points. Upgrading the grid to a higher capaciy system is
                                straightforward and different capacity tiers of fluxduct interoperate seemlessly without needing any extra equipment.</p>
                                
                                <p>Actually Additions energy laser relays are also unchanged and are a mid cost solution that can transmit power through walls and other obstructions. However
                                unlike the other two options lasers lose some energy in the trasmission process. The cost of a laser based grid scales more with the number of connection
                                points and the lasers themselves can be seemlessly exchanged for fluid and item transferring versions. Upgrading the lasers to higher capacity isn't to hard
                                and different laser tiers interoperate seemlessly, although the entire grid will suffer the loss rate of the highest tier laser in the chain.</p>
                                
                                <p>Other mods like Ender IO also add power transmission systems. They have not been changed but they may be rebalanced if needed to keep them in line with
                                everything else.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Teleportation Systems</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>The Rftools teleporter always bothered me. The cost of six ender pearls per location prevented it from being built early game and kept it rare in mid game
                                but once someone found The End not only could they easily mass produce teleporters but they could also bypass the ender dragon fight if they were properly
                                prepared. This created more of a floodgate situation than a progression system.</p>
                                
                                <p>To address this the Rftools teleporters have been made more expensive and the Waystones mod has been added to create additional teleportation options. The
                                general idea is that a Waystone based teleportation network, while still expensive to make, is much cheaper than a network based on the Rftools teleporter.
                                Waystones are also more user friendly and do not require RF power. They also offer a more fantasy style asthetic verses the tech asthetic from Rftools. This
                                lets people make asthetic choices without sacraficing gameplay capabilites, which I feel is a good thing.</p>
                                
                                <p>Waystones are pretty simple. You make one, place it in the world, and give it a name. You then right click it to "activate" it. You can then right click on
                                any waystone to teleport to any other waystone that you have previously activated. So they basically work like WoW flight points in the sense that the first
                                trip to a waystone placed by someone else needs to be made via other means. And then once you have been there once you can freely teleport there.</p>
                                
                                <p>The warp stone acts like a flight master's whistle from WoW. Holding right click with it in your hand will let you teleport to any waystone you have
                                activated. It has a 5 minute cooldown but this can be changed in the server config if people feel that it is too long or too short. The warp scroll is just
                                a cheaper single use version of the warp stone.</p>
                                
                                <p>Note that Waystones and the warp stone/warp scroll cannot traverse dimensions like the Rftools teleporter can.</p>
