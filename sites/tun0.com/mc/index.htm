                            <p><strong>Overall Goals</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                I once heard Direwolf20 say that the goal of his pack was to let people play the way they wanted by giving them multiple ways to do everything. I have
                                taken this to heart and providing multiple equally valid choices for every situation or task is the main goal of both my additional mod choices and my
                                balance changes.
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Early Game Power Systems</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <p>Early game power systems were a bit out of whack. The solar panel couldn't even be built early game and the windmill and water wheel just didn't
                                make enough power to be worth effort required to build them. The coal generator from Actually Additions was far and away the best option early on.
                                Now all three are competitive early game power options with different pros and cons.</p>
                                
                                <p>The solar panel is super cheap and does not need fuel but is low output due to only working during the day. This prevents it from providing constant
                                power without some sort of battery system. Solar panels also create a very large number of grid connection points. The connection point requirments and
                                low output prevent solar panels from scaling into mid game very well.</p>
                                
                                <p>The windmill and water wheel make the most power and do not need any fuel but require the most effort and space to setup. They force you to spend a
                                lot of time and resources to get the most out of them and they force your power grid to cover more distance than the other early game generation options
                                do. The large space requirments of these systems make it hard to scale windmills and water wheels into mid game.</p>
                                
                                <p>The coal generator needs fuel but makes a reasonable amount of power. It is compact, easy to build, and does not force you to make your power grid
                                larger than it needs to be. Although it does not waste fuel it is not very fuel efficient and the constant need for low energy density fuel keeps it from
                                scaling into mid game.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Mid Game Power Systems</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <p>Mid game power systems were rather lacking. In older Direwolf20 packs the only reasonable options were spruce trees with Thermal Expansion machines or
                                canola oil from Actually Additions. Everything else just wasn't up to par. We now have more options. The main mid game power systems are listed in order
                                of roughly how hard/expensive they are to set up starting with the easiest/cheapest. The harder and/or more expensive an option is, the better it scales to
                                larger amounts of power production. There is a lot of overlap in the overall capibilites of these systems. This is intentional as it makes them all
                                potentially viable choices depending on your mid game power needs and what resources you have avilable. Note that all of these are technically renewable
                                power sources, even Oil.</p>
                                
                                <p>Thermoelectric Generators have been buffed into a mid game power option. They are easy to setup but they do require some planning to avoid setting your
                                base on fire. Although their output is much better than before they don't have any upgrade options like the other systems do and makeing a lot of them starts
                                to need more lava than you may want to bother with. This makes scaling them somewhat hard.</p>
                                
                                <p>Canola Oil is unchanged. It is easy to setup and can make a reasonable amount of power in a renewable fashon. However it does not scale very well due
                                to the manual nature of higher tier canola refining and the generation limits of each oil generator.</p>
                                
                                <p>Tree Oil, aka Spruce Power, was a bit overpowered in earlier versions of Thermal Expansion and has been severely nerfed by the TE devs. They overdid the
                                nerf a bit and so it has been partially walked back. However the lower energy density of the fuel, the new requirment to spread extractors out across many
                                trees, and its reliance on the boiler/turbine conversion mechanic for high output keeps tree oil from scaling as well as the remaining two options.</p>
                                
                                <p>Grassoline is a new renewable power option in Thermal Expansion. The idea is that you process crops such as wheat into a liquid fuel that is then burned
                                for power. It takes more work to setup than tree power but scales better and eventually gets the option to move away from the boiler/turbine conversion
                                mechanic to a more efficient, and eventually more powerful, design based on the agitative manafold. If you dabble in Immersive Engineering enough to get the
                                garden cloche this becomes a very powerful generation system.</p>
                                
                                <p>Oil Power uses a mix of things from Thermal Expansion and Immersive Petroleum. First you have to use a core sample drill to locate a chuck with an oil
                                deposit. Then you have to build a pumpjack multiblock structure to extract the oil. The oil can then be processed into refined fuel and burned for energy.
                                This is a lot of effort and requires that you go down the Immersive Engineering tech tree to some extent. However it scales the best and has the easiest
                                time moving away from the boiler/turbine conversion mechanic to a far more efficient and powerful ignition plugs based design. It is also able to produce
                                sulfur and even cerosote oil as a byproduct of energy production.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Power Transmission Systems</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <p>Immersive Engineering wires are a low cost low capacity system overall. The cost of a powergrid based on IE wires scales up more so with the number of
                                connection points on the grid and less so with the distance the grid covers. Upgrading the grid to a higher capacity tier is more involved than with other
                                systems and connecting lower and higher tier wires requires extra transformer equipment.</p>
                                
                                <p>Thermal Dynamics fluxduct is an expensive but high capacity system that offers some residual energy storage. The cost of a fluxduct based grid scales more
                                with the distance the grid covers and less from the number of connection points. Upgrading the grid to a higher capaciy system is straightforward and different
                                capacity tiers of fluxduct interoperate seemlessly without needing any extra equipment.</p>
                                
                                <p>Actually Additions energy laser relays are a mid cost solution that can transmit power through walls and other obstructions. However unlike the other two
                                options lasers lose some energy in the trasmission process. The cost of a laser based grid scales more with the number of connection points and the lasers
                                themselves can be seemlessly exchanged for fluid and item transferring versions. Upgrading the lasers to higher capacity isn't to hard and different laser
                                tiers interoperate seemlessly, although the entire grid will suffer the loss rate of the highest tier laser in the chain.</p>
                                
                                <p>Other mods like Ender IO also add power transmission systems. They have not been changed but they may be rebalanced if needed to keep them in line with
                                everything else.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Teleportation Systems</strong></p>

                                <p>The Rftools teleporter always bothered me. The cost of six ender pearls per location prevented it from being built early game and kept it rare in mid game
                                but once someone found The End not only could they easily mass produce teleporters but they could also bypass the ender dragon fight if they were properly
                                prepared. This created more of a floodgate situation than a progression system.</p>
                                
                                <p>To address this the Rftools teleporters have been made more expensive and the Waystones mod has been added to create additional teleportation options. The
                                general idea is that a Waystone based teleportation network, while still expensive to make, is much cheaper than a network based on the Rftools teleporter.
                                Waystones are also more user friendly and do not require RF power. They also offer a more fantasy style asthetic verses the tech asthetic from Rftools. This
                                lets people make asthetic choices without sacraficing gameplay capabilites, which I feel is a good thing.</p>
                                
                                <p>Waystones are pretty simple. You make one, place it in the world, and give it a name. You then right click it to "activate" it. You can then right click on
                                any waystone to teleport to any other waystone that you have previously activated. So they basically work like WoW flight points in the sense that The first
                                trip to a waystone placed by someone else needs to be made via other means. And then once you have been there once you can freely teleport there.</p>
                                
                                <p>The warp stone acts like a flight master's whistle from WoW. Holding right click with it in your hand will let you teleport to any waystone you have
                                activated. It has a 5 minute cooldown but this can be changed in the server config if people feel that it is too long or too short.</p>
                                
                                <p>Note that Waystones and the warp stone cannot traverse dimensions like the Rftools teleporter can.</p>
