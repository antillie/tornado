                            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                            <p class="right-indent">Altana started off as a few craft tweaker changes to <a href="https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-presents-direwolf20-1-12">FTB's
                            Direwolf20 mod pack</a>. It has since diverged into its own pack with a number of mods added, a few mods removed, a fair number of config file changes, and a
                            large number of craft tweaker changes to facilitate mod interaction.</p>
                            
                            <p class="right-indent">Don't worry, its not <strong>that</strong> different from Direwolf20, if you are used to the Official mainline FTB packs you will feel
                            right at home with the Thermal Series, EnderIO, Immersive Engineering, Astral Sorcery, Botania, Thaumcraft, and the like. As a general rule things that have been
                            changed are now easier and/or cheaper, not harder or more expensive.</p>
                            
                            <p class="right-indent">Altana is a kitchen sink pack that focuses on modern modded Minecraft. There are more mods than most individual players will ever need
                            and there is a lot of functionality overlap between various mods. But while Altana does reward mixing different mods in a number of places it does not require
                            you to do so like an expert mode pack would. Altana also jettisons some holdovers from earlier Minecraft eras, notably Buildcraft and Industrial Craft 2. These
                            mods aren't bad, they just represent older styles of gameplay that I feel have run their course. Older things need to be removed to make way for newer ideas
                            and ways of doing things to keep the game fresh.</p>
                            
                            <p class="right-indent">I made Altana because I felt that the Direwolf20 mod pack could be even better. The FTB team does an amazing job of keeping the Direwolf20
                            pack stable but they don't really spend time balancing things or enabling inter mod interaction. I felt that there were too many cases where one way of doing
                            something was clearly superior to all of the other options. I also felt that there were a number of places where mods could interact in ways that would encorage,
                            but not require, people to branch out and play more than one mod or try out mods they hadn't used before.</p>
                            
                            <p class="right-indent">I also saw room to add new gameplay and asthetic options by adding a few new mods. The magic side of things has seen significant expansion
                            with the addition of Electroblob's Wizardry. Void Craft and The Betweenland add even more dungeon and exploration based gameplay for those that like the Twilight
                            Forest while Ice and Fire makes the Overworld feel much more interesting.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Resource Packs and Optifine</strong></p>
                            <p class="right-indent">Altana includes the Persistance resource pack by default because I feel it does a good of making minecraft look better without
                            deviating too much from the vanilla asthetic. At the moment Altana includes Optifine becase it is more or less a private mod pack. If I ever decide to publish
                            Altana on Curseforge Optifine will have to be removed.</p>
                            
                        </div>
                        <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">

                            <p><strong>Overall Goals</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>I once heard Direwolf20 say that the goal of his pack was to let people play the way they wanted by giving them multiple ways to do everything. I have
                                taken this to heart and providing multiple equally valid choices for every situation or task is one of the main goals of both my additional mod choices
                                and my balance changes. The other main goal is to add more content to the game so people have lots of different things to do. I also want both magic and
                                tech themed game play styles to be equally possible and powerful.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Early Game Power Systems</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>Early game power systems were a bit out of whack. The solar panel couldn't even be built early game and the windmill and water wheel just didn't
                                make enough power to be worth the effort required to build them. The coal generator from Actually Additions was far and away the best option early on.
                                Now all three are competitive early game power options with different pros and cons.</p>
                                
                                <p>The solar panel is super cheap and does not need fuel but is low output due to only working during the day. This prevents it from providing constant
                                power without some sort of battery system. Solar panels also create a very large number of grid connection points. The connection point requirments and
                                low output prevent solar panels from scaling into mid game very well.</p>
                                
                                <p>The windmill and water wheel make the most power and do not need any fuel but require the most effort and space to setup. They force you to spend a
                                lot of time and resources to get the most out of them and they force your power grid to cover more distance than the other early game generation options
                                do. The large space requirments of these systems make it hard to scale windmills and water wheels into mid game.</p>
                                
                                <p>The coal generator needs fuel but makes a reasonable amount of power. It is compact, easy to build, and does not force you to make your power grid
                                larger than it needs to be. Although it does not waste fuel it is not very fuel efficient and the constant need for low energy density fuel keeps it from
                                scaling into mid game.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Mid Game Power Systems</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>Mid game power systems were rather lacking. In older Direwolf20 packs the only reasonable options were spruce trees with Thermal Expansion machines or
                                canola oil from Actually Additions. Everything else just wasn't up to par. We now have more options. The main mid game power systems are listed in order
                                of roughly how hard/expensive they are to set up starting with the easiest/cheapest. The harder and/or more expensive an option is, the better it scales to
                                larger amounts of power production. There is a lot of overlap in the overall capibilites of these systems. This is intentional as it makes them all
                                potentially viable choices depending on your mid game power needs and what resources you have avilable. Note that all of these are technically renewable
                                power sources, even Oil.</p>
                                
                                <p>Thermoelectric Generators have been buffed into a mid game power option. They are easy to setup but they do require some planning to avoid setting your
                                base on fire. Although their output is much better than before it still isn't amazing and they don't have any upgrade options like the other systems do. Also
                                making a lot of them starts to need more lava than you may want to bother with. This makes scaling them somewhat hard.</p>
                                
                                <p>Canola Oil is unchanged. It is easy to setup and can make a reasonable amount of power in a renewable fashon. However it does not scale very well due
                                to the manual nature of higher tier canola refining and the generation limits of each oil generator.</p>
                                
                                <p>Tree Oil, aka Spruce Power, was a bit overpowered in earlier versions of Thermal Expansion and has been severely nerfed by the TE devs. They overdid the
                                nerf a bit and so it has been partially walked back. However the lower energy density of the fuel, the new requirment to spread extractors out across many
                                trees, and its reliance on the boiler/turbine conversion mechanic for high output keeps tree oil from scaling as well as the remaining two options.</p>
                                
                                <p>Grassoline is a new renewable power option in Thermal Expansion. The idea is that you process crops such as wheat into a liquid fuel that is then burned
                                for power. It takes more work to setup than tree power but scales better and eventually gets the option to move away from the boiler/turbine conversion
                                mechanic to a more efficient, and eventually more powerful, design based on the agitative manafold. If you dabble in Immersive Engineering enough to get the
                                garden cloche this becomes a very powerful generation system.</p>
                                
                                <p>Oil Power uses a mix of things from Thermal Expansion and Immersive Petroleum. First you have to use a core sample drill to locate a chuck with an oil
                                deposit. Then you have to build a pumpjack multiblock structure to extract the oil. The oil can then be processed into refined fuel and burned for energy.
                                This is a lot of effort and requires that you go down the Immersive Engineering tech tree to some extent. However it scales the best and has the easiest
                                time moving away from the boiler/turbine conversion mechanic to a far more efficient and powerful ignition plugs based design. It is also able to produce
                                sulfur and even cerosote oil as a byproduct of energy production.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Power Transmission Systems</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>Immersive Engineering wires are a low cost low capacity system overall. The cost of a powergrid based on IE wires scales up more so with the number of
                                connection points on the grid and less so with the distance the grid covers. Upgrading the grid to a higher capacity tier is more involved than with other
                                systems and connecting lower and higher tier wires requires extra transformer equipment.</p>
                                
                                <p>Thermal Dynamics fluxducts are unchanged and provide an expensive but high capacity system that offers some residual energy storage. The cost of a fluxduct
                                based grid scales more with the distance the grid covers and less from the number of connection points. Upgrading the grid to a higher capaciy system is
                                straightforward and different capacity tiers of fluxduct interoperate seemlessly without needing any extra equipment.</p>
                                
                                <p>Actually Additions energy laser relays are also unchanged and are a mid cost solution that can transmit power through walls and other obstructions. However
                                unlike the other two options lasers lose some energy in the trasmission process. The cost of a laser based grid scales more with the number of connection
                                points and the lasers themselves can be seemlessly exchanged for fluid and item transferring versions. Upgrading the lasers to higher capacity isn't to hard
                                and different laser tiers interoperate seemlessly, although the entire grid will suffer the loss rate of the highest tier laser in the chain.</p>
                                
                                <p>Other mods like Ender IO also add power transmission systems. They have not been changed but they may be rebalanced if needed to keep them in line with
                                everything else.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Teleportation Systems</strong></p>
                            <div class="right-indent">
                                <p>The Rftools teleporter always bothered me. The cost of six ender pearls per location prevented it from being built early game and kept it rare in mid game
                                but once someone found The End not only could they easily mass produce teleporters but they could also bypass the ender dragon fight if they were properly
                                prepared. This created more of a floodgate situation than a progression system.</p>
                                
                                <p>To address this the Rftools teleporters have been made more expensive and the Waystones mod has been added to create additional teleportation options. The
                                general idea is that a Waystone based teleportation network, while still expensive to make, is much cheaper than a network based on the Rftools teleporter.
                                Waystones are also more user friendly and do not require RF power. They also offer a more fantasy style asthetic verses the tech asthetic from Rftools. This
                                lets people make asthetic choices without sacraficing gameplay capabilites, which I feel is a good thing.</p>
                                
                                <p>Waystones are pretty simple. You make one, place it in the world, and give it a name. You then right click it to "activate" it. You can then right click on
                                any waystone to teleport to any other waystone that you have previously activated. So they basically work like WoW flight points in the sense that the first
                                trip to a waystone placed by someone else needs to be made via other means. And then once you have been there once you can freely teleport there.</p>
                                
                                <p>The warp stone acts like a flight master's whistle from WoW. Holding right click with it in your hand will let you teleport to any waystone you have
                                activated. It has a 5 minute cooldown but this can be changed in the server config if people feel that it is too long or too short. The warp scroll is just
                                a cheaper single use version of the warp stone.</p>
                                
                                <p>Note that Waystones and the warp stone/warp scroll cannot traverse dimensions like the Rftools teleporter can.</p>

                                <p>IC2 is a poorly designed mod. Not in the sense that it isn't well made, because it is very well made. But poorly designed in the sense that it goes out of
                                its way to punish players for using it. Crafting in IC2 is excessivly tedious, machines can only be picked up in the one anointed way, it is not compatable
                                with the standard RF power system, and it forces you to manage three power grids with no easy way to make them interconnect. Given how repulsive IC2 is for
                                players its inclusion in the Direwolf20 pack is just bloat. Everything IC2 provides is also provided by other mods in ways that are more user friendly, more
                                powerful, or both. Choices are good but IC2 actively limits your choices due its unwillingness to implement cross mod compatibility or adapt to the modern
                                modded Minecraft landscape.</p>
                                
                                <p>In a nutshell the only thing that makes IC2 stand out at all is the fact that it is a walled garden that refuses to interact with the outside world and
                                the only gameplay it really offers is the distain for its players that those walls are made out of. However if someone specifically asks for IC2 it can be
                                re added to the pack without much trouble. But if someone asks for it and I put it back they had better use it. <span class="larger-text">&#x1F609;</span></p>
