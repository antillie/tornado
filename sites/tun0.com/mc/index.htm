                            <p><strong>Early Game Power Systems</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <p>Early game power systems were a bit out of whack. The solar panel couldn't even be built early game and the windmill and water wheel just didn't
                                make enough power to be worth effort required to build them. The coal generator from Actually Additions was far and away the best option early on.
                                Now all three are competitive early game power options with different pros and cons.</p>
                                
                                <p>The solar panel is super cheap and does not need fuel but is low output due to only working during the day. This prevents it from providing constant
                                power without some sort of battery system. Solar panels also create a very large number of grid connection points. The connection point requirments and
                                low output prevent solar panels from scaling into mid game very well.</p>
                                
                                <p>The windmill and water wheel make the most power and do not need any fuel but require the most effort and space to setup. They force you to spend a
                                lot of time and resources to get the most out of them and they force your power grid to cover more distance than the other early game generation options
                                do. The large space requirments of these systems make it hard to scale windmills and water wheels into mid game.</p>
                                
                                <p>The coal generator needs fuel but makes a reasonable amount of power. It is compact, easy to build, and does not force you to make your power grid
                                larger than it needs to be. Although it does not waste fuel it is not very fuel efficient and the constant need for low energy density fuel keeps it from
                                scaling into mid game.</p>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p><strong>Mid Game Power Systems</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <p>Mid game power systems were a bit lacking. In older Direwolf20 packs the only reasonable options were spruce trees with Thermal Expansion machines or
                                canola oil from Actually Additions. Everything else just wasn't up to par. We now have more options. The main mid game power systems are listed in order
                                of roughly how hard/expensive they are to set up starting with the easiest/cheapest. The harder and/or more expensive an option is, the better it scales to
                                larger amounts of power production. There is a lot of overlap in the overall capibilites of these systems, this is intentional as it makes them all
                                potentially viable choices depending on your mid game power needs and what resources you have avilable.</p>
                                
                                <p>Canola Oil is unchanged. It is easy to setup and can make a reasonable amount of power in a renewable fashon. However it does not scale very well due
                                to the manual nature of higher tier canola refining and the generation limits of each oil generator.</p>
                                
                                <p>Tree Oil, aka Spruce Power, was a bit overpowered in earlier versions of Thermal Expansion and has been severely nerfed by the TE devs. They overdid the
                                nerf a bit and so it has been partially walked back. However the lower energy density of the fuel, the new requirment to spread extractors out across many
                                trees, and its reliance on the boiler/turbine conversion mechanic for high output keeps tree oil from scaling as well as the remaining two options.</p>
                                
                                <p>Grassoline is a new renewable power option in Thermal Expansion. The idea is that you process crops such as wheat into a liquid fuel that is then burned
                                for power. It takes more work to setup than tree power but scales better and eventually gets the option to move away from the boiler/turbine conversion
                                mechanic to a more efficient, and eventually more powerful, design based on the agitative manafold. If you dabble in Immersive Engineering enough to get the
                                garden cloche this becomes a very powerful generation system.</p>
                                
                                <p>Oil Power uses a mix of things from Thermal Expansion and Immersive Petroleum. First you have to use a core sample drill to locate a chuck with an oil
                                deposit. Then you have to build a pumpjack multiblock structure to extract the oil. The oil can then be processed into refined fuel and burned for energy.
                                This is a lot of effort and requires that you go down the Immersive Engineering tech tree to some extent. However it scales the best and has the easiest
                                time moving away from the boiler/turbine conversion mechanic to a far more efficient and powerful ignition plugs based design. It is also able to produce
                                sulfur and even cerosote oil as a byproduct of energy production.</p>
