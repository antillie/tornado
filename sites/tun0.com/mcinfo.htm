            <h3>Balance Changes:</h3>
            <p>
                The Actually Additions solar panel has been made significantly cheaper to craft. It is now a viable early game power source.<br><br>
                
                The Immersive Engineering Windmill and Water Wheel have had their power output increased to better match the effort and space needed to set them up.<br><br>
                
                The Immersive Engineering Powered Lantern and Floodlight no longer require power to function. This was done for server performace reasons. However they are a bit more expensive to craft now.<br><br>
                
                Transmission loss has been removed from all Immersive Engineering wires.<br><br>
                
                Immersive Engineering wire coils, wire connectors, and wire relays are all much cheaper to craft.<br><br>
                
                Insulating Immersive Engineering wire coils is now slighly cheaper.<br><br>
                
                Creosote Oil can now be used to make various type of meat jerky.<br><br>
                
                The Immersive Engineering Blast Furnace is now easier to build.<br><br>
                
                The Immersive Engineering Blast Furnace can now make marble from limestone.<br><br>
                
                Some IC2 Macerator recipies have been duplicated to the IE Crusher and TE Pulverizer. This makes some non IC2 things producable outside of IC2.<br><br>
                
                IC2 Advanced Alloy can now be made in the IE Metal Press and TE Compactor. This allows for smoother advanced generator turbine progression without needing to use IC2.<br><br>
                
                The Engineer's Hammer can once again make plates from ingots.<br><br>
                
                Immersive Engineering fluid pipe is now much cheaper to craft.<br><br>
                
                Tar can now be melted into Creosote Oil.<br><br>
                
                Paper can now be made from Industrial Hemp.<br><br>
                
                Gold Plated Turbine Rotors are now craftable again.<br><br>
                
                The Tinkers Construct Crafting Station is back.<br><br>
                
                Immersive Engineering MV Wire Coils have had their maximum range increased to 24 blocks.<br><br>
                
                IC2 cables no longer melt when you try to put too much power through them.<br><br>
                
                IC2 machines no longer explode when you supply them with the wrong voltage.<br><br>
                
                The Resonanting Wand still doesn't detect Rock Crystal Ore (a bug in the mod). However Rock Crystal Ore is now much more common to compensate. Its still rare though.<br><br>
